1.  Overview The goal of this assignment was to understand the structure
    of a JavaScript Tetris implementation and to design AI agents that
    can play the game automatically. The task included analyzing the
    base code, improving the heuristic evaluation, implementing a new
    search-based agent (Beam Search), and comparing their performance.

2.  Heuristic Agent The first agent uses a weighted heuristic to
    evaluate the quality of the Tetris board after each possible move.
    The main features include: Aggregate height – total column height of
    the board Complete lines – number of filled rows Holes – empty
    spaces under blocks Bumpiness – difference in height between
    adjacent columns Additional terms such as well depth, max height,
    and roughness The heuristic score is computed as a weighted sum of
    these values. This agent evaluates every legal move and selects the
    one with the best score. It performs decently, but its decisions are
    short-sighted, since it only considers the immediate next move.

3.  Beam Search Agent The second agent, implemented in beam_agent.js,
    expands on this idea by looking several steps ahead. Instead of
    choosing only the single best immediate move, it keeps a small set
    of the top-scoring board states (the beam). At each step it
    generates all possible next states, evaluates them, and keeps the
    best few for the next level. The Beam Search allows the agent to
    plan more strategically, avoiding configurations that would later
    create deep holes or high towers. A beam width of 5 and a depth of
    1–2 were used to keep the computation time reasonable while
    improving accuracy.

4.  Results Both agents were tested in the same environment using the
    same random sequence of pieces. Agent Average Score Rows Cleared
    Behavior Heuristic Agent

The Beam Search agent consistently achieved higher scores and produced
smoother, flatter surfaces. It also delayed losing situations by better
positioning of long pieces.

5.  Conclusions The project successfully demonstrates how search-based
    AI can improve decision making in dynamic environments such as
    Tetris. While the heuristic agent focuses on immediate board
    conditions, the Beam Search agent achieves more robust play by
    exploring multiple possible futures. This assignment helped to
    better understand how evaluation functions and limited-depth search
    interact in game AI. Future improvements could include increasing
    the search depth, experimenting with dynamic beam widths, or
    implementing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for comparison.
